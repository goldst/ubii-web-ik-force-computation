# ubii-web-ik-force-computation
Ubi-Interact Inverse Kinematics and force computation for web browsers. This is a necessary step in physical embodiment scenarios, where users are represented virtually through a physical avatar.

## Usage
Ubii-web-ik-force-computation can be used either as a standalone demo or as a node module in Your own applications.

## Prerequisites
This project communicates with a [Ubi-Interact master node](https://github.com/SandroWeber/ubii-node-master). Even though some of the functionality can be tested without it, it is recommended to have one.

To calculate a full pose using inverse kinematics, this module receives IK targets from another Ubi-Interact component. [ubii-web-target-publisher](https://github.com/goldst/ubii-web-target-publisher) simplifies the process of publishing targets using abstractions similar to the ones in this module.

To calculate the necessary forces and applying them to a physical avatar, this module needs to communicate with other Ubi-Interact components. [ubii-web-avatar-applier](https://github.com/goldst/ubii-web-target-publisher) simplifies this process using similar abstractions to this module as well.

### Online Demo
The demo in this project is available at https://goldst.dev/ubii-web-ik-force-computation.

### Running the demo locally
After cloning, install, and run the project:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Your terminal will contain the demo URL, e.g. http://localhost:8080. Note that the command starts a development server which is not suitable for production environments.

### Using this project as a node module
To your existing node project, add the module:
```bash
npm i ubii-web-ik-force-computation
```

You can either initialize the processor in HTML using the bundled version:
```html
<script src=".node_modules/ubii-web-ik-force-computation/dist/bundle.js"></script>

<script>
    new UbiiWebIkForceComputation.Processor(options);
</script>
```

Or you can import it directly in your JavaScript/TypeScript project:
```js
import { Processor } from 'ubii-web-ik-force-computation';

new Processor(options);
```

For available options, see [ProcessorOptions.ts](./src/ProcessorOptions.ts).

That's it! Other than supplying the options, no further configuration is necessary. If you want to stop the processor, just call `stop()` on the processor object.

## Technical Details
The general structure of this project is similar to [ubii-web-target-publisher](https://github.com/goldst/ubii-web-target-publisher) and [ubii-web-avatar-applier](https://github.com/goldst/ubii-web-target-publisher), however, it is somewhat more complex:

The Processor either directly (`useDevice===true`) or indirectly (`false`) creates an instance of HumanIK, a class which sets up bones and constraints using [IK.ts](https://github.com/goldst/ik.ts) and calculates them on demand. ik.ts is very constrained in the amount and kind of constraints it offers, thus, the human pose will not be completely realistic.

When `useDevice` is `false` (default setting), this module creates a processing module, which is doing the same thing, but has more potential for optimization. With some changes, it may run in a separate thread. The code for processing modules (folders `devices`, `nodes`, `processing` with the exception of `processing/ProcessingModuleAvatarMotionControls.ts`, `storage`) is taken from [ubii-node-nodejs](https://github.com/SandroWeber/ubii-node-nodejs), and only slightly modified â€“ very generous broad were added so that it works with TypeScript, and some lines of code were changed to ensure compatibility with [ubii-node-webbrowser](https://github.com/SandroWeber/ubii-node-webbrowser).
